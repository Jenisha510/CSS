        Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty
         and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly 
         interact with family groups when looking for a mate. 
         They enter a state of increased testosterone and 
         aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success.
          Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years.
           Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates.
            and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and possibly show concern for dying and dead individuals of their kind.
